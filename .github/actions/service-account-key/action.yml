      Service account key to use for authentication. This should be the JSON
      formatted private key which can be exported from the Cloud Console. The
      value can be raw or base64-encoded. This will make the credentials
      available to later steps via the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
      environment variable. Future steps that consume Application Default
      Credentials will automatically detect and use these credentials.
